Mapbox for Openframeworks IOS

I've been struggeling with the limitations of the MapKit library in openframeworks so 
I was obligated to modify MapBox to work together with Openframeworks. This is an early
release. 

Wat is possible right now:

- top layer EaglView
- add custom MBTiles with offlineMap(string map)

What is going to come:

- route-me navigation (on the openframeworks layer)
- cycle map source
- sea map layers
