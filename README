Mapbox for Openframeworks IOS

I've been struggeling with the limitations of the MapKit library in openframeworks so 
I had  to modify MapBox to work together with Openframeworks. This is an early
release. See the testMap.mm for examples.

I'm aware that this library isn't supported by 0073 yet. I'll be updating this library the next two 
months and add retina support. I'll be updating the route system with a better option.

Wat is possible right now:

- top layer EaglView
- add custom MBTiles with offlineMap(string map)
- online maps onlineMap("URL") // tilemap server reccomended.. see tilestream for your own map.
- YOUR route system from Open Steet Maps
