Mapbox for Openframeworks IOS


I'm aware that this library isn't supported by 0074 yet. It is now! Look in the development branch.




I've been struggeling with the limitations of the MapKit library in openframeworks so 
I had  to modify MapBox to work together with Openframeworks. This is an early
release. See the testMap.mm for examples.

Wat is possible right now:

- top layer EaglView
- add custom MBTiles with offlineMap(string map)
- online maps onlineMap("URL") 
    look at the tileStream github to stream a map from your own (VPS)server.
    When you are hosting, use http://[host name]/v2/[map name].json as URL.
    Here's a tutorial for a Ubuntu server: https://github.com/mapbox/tilestream/issues/50
